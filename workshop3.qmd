# Learning objectives

::: callout-important
## Philosophy

Workshops are not a test. You may make a lot of mistakes - that is fine. It's OK to need help. the staff are here to help you, so don't be afraid to ask for help! :-)
:::

## Technical skills

Today we will work with plotting movement data from the Livecyte microscope.

We will learn some new R plotting skills:

-   `facet_wrap` a method to plot one variable split up over different treatments (or chromosomes, or days, or replicates)
-   how to create a **correlation data frame** using the `correlate` function. This allows us to explore many correlations between different metrics. Typically, these metrics are stored in the *columns* of our data frames.

## Thinking like a data scientist

We encourage you to develop your data handling skills. By:

-   keeping our script clear, simple, and well-annotated
-   developing your own habits to keep your awareness on **what data the data contains**

::: callout-warning
## Know your data!

To understand the biology captured in the data, you need to know what is in the data. At each step, be sure you know the rows, the columns and what they mean. Keep notes about this in your script.
:::

# Introduction

## The biology

Today, we will continue our quest to understand **mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)**. Remember, the two clones we are studying were both obtained from *one person*, and they have been transformed with telomerase to make them immortal (so they don't age). Then, they have been cultured in a lab for years.

In [workshop 2](https://djeffares.github.io/BIO66I/workshop2.html), we saw that these two clones were different shapes. This time, we examine how they *move*.

::: callout-tip
## Sometimes, asking a good question is the most important step!

Why do these clones maintain different shapes after growing in the lab for so long? Why don't they revert to being the same?
:::

## The data

In this workshop, we first examine cell movement data that was collected in an automated way by the Livecyte microscope. This shows something interesting, but it is not very reliable, because the Livecyte is *not perfect* at tracking individual cells.

People are better at tracking individual cells. So we then look at some *manual* tracking data. We will se such metrics as `euclidean.distance` (how far the cells have moved), `mean.speed` (how fast they go), and `meandering.index` (how much they *meander* and change their minds about where they are going!).

While we could *guess* how the cells differ from looking down the microscope, we can use our data science skills in two ways to enrich our perception, by:

-   showing metrics with plots - this will enhance out intuition
-   using statistical tests to test our intuitions
-   the tests will determine which metrics (if any) are **significantly different** between the clones

This work transforms intuitions into evidence.

## Research questions

-   Do the two mesenchymal stromal cell clones move differently?
-   What data set(s) are most reliable?
-   What are the best parameters to distinguish the clones?

# Exercises

## Setting up

-   Start up R Studio, and open your Project.
-   Open the script your worked on in [workshop 2](https://djeffares.github.io/BIO66I/workshop2.html)

We will keep working on this script. We advise you to mark clearly where workshop 1, workshop 2 and workshop 3 are. Something like this will help:

```{r}
########################################################
#WORKSHOP 3: CELL MOVEMENT DATA
########################################################
```

Then clear the previous work, and load the libraries we need:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: true

#clear previous data
rm(list=ls())

#load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

#load the corr library: this is for examining correlations between many metrics
library(corrr)

#we need this to make pretty plots with the 'ggarrange' package
library(ggpubr)

```

## Automated Livecyte cell movment data

Now read in the data from the file **all-cell-data-FFT.filtered.2024-02-22.tsv**. This contains some cell movment data.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: true

# Read the automated Livecyte data
cells <-read_tsv(url("https://djeffares.github.io/BIO66I/all-cell-data-FFT.filtered.2024-02-22.tsv"),
                 col_types = cols(
                   clone = col_factor(),
                   replicate = col_factor(),
                   tracking.id=col_factor(),
                   lineage.id=col_factor()
                 )
)
```

Lets see what data we have:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

names(cells)
```

::: callout-important
## Keep it simple

In data science, we can easily get confused. keep the data as simple as you can (but no simpler).
:::

In the spirit of **keeping it simple**, let's retain only the columns in this data frame that we need, using the `select` function. The `cells` data framt still have all the data, so it is not lost.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: true

names(cells)
#select only the columns we need
cell.move.data <- select(cells,
        clone,
        replicate,
        displacement, 
        track.length, 
        instantaneous.velocity
)
#check that we have
names(cell.move.data)

#get a simple summaru, using summary and also glimpse
summary(cell.move.data)
glimpse(cell.move.data)
```


Now save your working data:

```{r}
#lets save our data
save.image("BIO00066I-workshop3-cell-movement-metrics.Rda")

#you can load this any time later with:
load("BIO00066I-workshop3-cell-movement-metrics.Rda")
```

## Making plots

let's see how clone A and clone B move. First, we'll plot the `instantaneous.velocity`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: true

#instantaneous.velocity - geom_violin
ggplot(cell.move.data,aes(x=clone,y=instantaneous.velocity,colour=clone))+
    geom_violin(alpha=0.5)+
    stat_compare_means()

```

This plot isn't very revealing is it? That is because most of the `instantaneous.velocity` values are very low, and the data are certainly not *normally distributed*. Biological data is often like this. Plotting metrics on a **log scale** is often the solution. Log^2^ or log^10^ scales are commonly used.

::: callout-tip
## Adjust this plot yourself

So that you plot `y=log10(instantaneous.velocity)`. Does it look better?
:::

::: callout-tip
## Enhance the plot with facet_wrap

This time, show the repeats by adding a new line to the plot code:

`facet_wrap(~replicate)+`

**What is `facet_wrap`?**. Our **first categorical value** that we split up the data into was clone A and clone B. `facet_wrap` splits the data up again into a **second categorical value**, and plots each category. In this case our second category was `~replicate`.
:::

If these adjustments to the code worked, you will end up with a plot like this. **What does this tell you about clone movement?**.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: true

ggplot(cell.move.data,aes(x=clone,y=log10(instantaneous.velocity),colour=clone))+
    geom_violin(alpha=0.5)+
    facet_wrap(~replicate)+
    stat_compare_means()
```

::: callout-tip
## Optional

Use your plot code to explore, `displacement`, `track.length` and/or `instantaneous.velocity`.
:::

## Manual tracking data

Sometimes, the automated measurements are not the best quality. In this case, we know that the Livecyte microscope is not very good at tracking cells, so the cell movement metrics are not as good as we would like.

So Amanda spent many hours *manually* tracking cells. These results were processed into manual tracking data. First, load the data and of course **examine what you have**.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: true

#load the manual tracking data
track <-read_tsv(url("https://djeffares.github.io/BIO66I/A1-and-B2-tracking.data.tsv"))

#check it out
glimpse(track)
names(track)
```

In this data, `TID` is the Livecyte **tracking ID**, a unique number that the microscope gives to each 'object' it can identify. `LID` is the Livecyte **lineage ID**. This keeps track of the cell lineage (ie: the initial cells, and the subsequent daughter cells that are derived from it as it divides). When a cell divides, both 'daughter cells' keep the same **lineage ID**, but each is assigned a new unique **tracking ID**.

::: callout-warning
## Different names, same metric!
Note that different analysis software can use different terminologies to define their metrics. How confusing! In our case `instantaneous.velocity` from the `cells` data frame is the same as `mean.speed` in the `tracking` data. Both of these metrics are a measure of distance traveled/time.
:::


![**Figure 1.** The **tracking ID (TID)** is a unique ID that the microscope assigned to each object (cell), as it tracks it through time. The **lineage ID (LID)** is a number assigned to the ‘family’ of cells that derived by cell division during the the experiment. When a cell divides, each daughter cell is given a new tracking ID, but they keep their lineage ID, because they are still part of the same family.](docs/figure1.jpg)

## Plotting manual tracking data

Let's start by looking at the **speed** that each cell moves at during the experiment. This is recorded as `mean.speed` in this data set (the same as the `instantenous.velocity` in the `cells` data set). We can compare the clones (`cell.line`) like so:

```{r}
#compare mean.speed between cell lines
ggplot(track, aes(x=cell.line,y=mean.speed))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  stat_compare_means()
```

::: callout-important
## Improve the plot

Try these things to improve this plot:

-   use `geom_violin` instead of `geom_boxplot`
-   adding `theme_classic`
-   making the *x*-axis and *y*-axis look better with `xlab("something")` and `ylab("something")`
-   giving the plot a title with `ggtitle("top title", subtitle ="sub text")`
:::

After the workshop, we advise you to plot some other movement metrics from the `tracking` data.

## Correlations abound!

With biological data (and data from many other sources), different measurements of the same set of 'things' are often correlated. For example, human height and weight are strongly correlated. So it is with cells.

We *could* examine each correlation one by one, like so:

```{r}
#examine whether track.length and mean.speed are correlated
cor.test(track$track.length,track$mean.speed,method="spearman")
```

::: callout-warning
## A Non parametric warning

Here we use the non parametric test `method="spearman` to calculate correlations, because we know from looking at the data that the `track.length` and probably `mean.speed` are not normally distributed. In a [Spearman rank correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient), `rho` is the correlation coefficient (sometimes rho is written using the Greek symbol **$\rho$**).
:::

But since there are 11 cell movment metrics, this would quickly become boring. And (just as importantly) the data would be a challenge to understand.

**Fortunately, there is an easier way.** First we use the `correlate` function to calculate all pairwise correlations. We save the correlation coefficients in the `track.correlations` data frame.

```{r}
#calculate all pairwise correlations
track.correlations <- 
  track |>
  correlate(method="spearman")
#see what we have
head(track.correlations)
```

Then we use `pivot_longer` ass we did in [BIO00066I core workshop 1](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs4/week-1/workshop.html#visualisation), to simplify the data format.

![**Figure 2.** How `pivot_longer` reshapes data. Notice that no data is lost. does.](https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/assets/img/posts/tidyr-longer-wider.gif)

We will use `pivot_longer` this way:

```{r}
#Adjust the name of the first column to "Variable1"
names(track.correlations)[1]="Variable1"

#simplify the data with pivot_longer
track.correlations.pivot <- 
  track.correlations |> 
  pivot_longer(-Variable1, names_to = "Variable2", values_to = "corr.coeff")

#examine what we have
head(track.correlations.pivot)
```

Finally, we can show all the correlation coefficients in one plot. This gives us a unique and revealing sense of the data.

```{r}
#plot data in the track.correlations.pivot table
#using geom_tile (for coloured boxes) and geom_text (to show the correlation coefficient values) 
ggplot(track.correlations.pivot, aes(Variable1, Variable2)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = corr.coeff)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(corr.coeff, 1))) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```


::: callout-tip
## Some points to note in this plot:
- `round(corr.coeff, 1)` reduces the number of  decimal places to 1.
- try the plot with only: ` geom_text(aes(label = corr.coeff))+` (eek!)
- `element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)` changes the direction of the x axis labels
- try omitting this line (again, eeek!)
- **the `geom_tile` method can be used to plot any pairwise interaction data**
:::



# Reflection

::: callout-important
## It is critical to think about what our analysis shows aout the biology
**Do this now.** 

- What do we know about the clones now?
- What do you know about how they move?
- Which metrics are correlated?
- What do correlations with negative $\rho$ mean?
:::


Today you have learned some data handling and plotting skills. These are:

- How to use `facet_wrap` to split plots by a second category
- How to plot values on a `log10()` scale
- How to 'lengthen' and simplify data using `pivot_longer`
- How to calculate and display numerous correlations in a grid with `geom_tile`


# After the workshop

## Consolodation exercises

### Explore the data

Use the code from section **3.5 Plotting manual tracking data** to plot other features of the manual tracking data. We advise you to plot: `track.length`, `track.duration`, `meandering.index`, and `euclidean.distance`.

Sometimes, we need to be careful with the data. For `track.length`, `track.duration`, we want to choose tracking data *only* for cells that we have observed it's entire life - from when it is 'born' from the parental cell, to when it divides again.

Fortunately, this information in the data already. We do *not* see the entire 'lifetime' of any cell tracked object that have the value `TRUE` in in the column `track.present.at.start.or.end`, because we starting tracking them some time after they were born, or stopped tracking them before they divided again.

So we can filter out these lines by putting `filter(track.present.at.start.or.end != TRUE)` in our code. Let's check if this makes any difference by comparing `track.length`without the filter, and then with the filter:

```{r}
#track.length without the filter
no.filter.plot<- track |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=cell.line, y = track.length))+
  geom_violin()+
  stat_compare_means()+
  ggtitle("no filter")

#track.length WITH the filter
filter.plot<- track |> 
  filter(track.present.at.start.or.end != TRUE) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=cell.line, y = track.length))+
  geom_violin()+
  stat_compare_means()+
  ggtitle("with filter")

#show plots side by side
ggarrange(no.filter.plot,filter.plot)

```

::: callout-note
# Did this make a difference?
- Did we get a different result after this 'cleaning up', with this large data set?
- Might we have a different result after this cleaning up, with a small data set?
:::


#### Explore other metrics

Try using the code above to explore other metrics in the `track` data other than `track.length`. Options include `track.duration`, track.duration.total.time`, `euclidean.distance` and `euclidean.distance`.

### Improve the correlation heat map

What if we wanted to show only the correlations where the absolute value of $\rho$ was greater than 0.25? Try using the pipe operator `|>` to filter the `track.correlations.pivot` data before plotting, with: 


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

#filter the data
track.correlations.pivot |>
  filter(abs(corr.coeff) > 0.25) |>
#now we put the plotting code here 
  ggplot(aes(Variable1, Variable2)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = corr.coeff)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(corr.coeff, 1))) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

## Planning for your report

The RStudio project is worth 30% of this module. The submission of your RStudio project should:

- have a logical folder structure for your analysis
- contain a well-commented script
- be well-organised and follow good practice in use of spacing, indentation and variable naming. 

The details are described [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qo2PCfF2Wi1hQKDV_rTaL3ssJotNFhVTAJqZI5DD_CQ/edit?usp=sharing).

The aim of all this is to make the code and the data analysis clear and readable for someone else.

So spending just **10 minutes** tidying your code now will make your future life easier. For example, look at your variable names, and make them clearer.
