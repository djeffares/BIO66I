MCSs are are multipotent cells, than can differentiate into many kinds of mesenchymal cells, including bone, cartilage and fat cells. They are not pluripotent, in that they do have limits about how they differentiate.\nMSCs are also:\n\nimmuno-modulatory (they make cytokines)\nheterogeneous (they have subpopulations that are different from each other)\n\nThe MSCs we are looking at are from bone marrow femoral head tissues (from the hip bone). These MSCs were immortalised (by transforming them with a telomerase gene), and then cloned by limiting dilution. We will compare the data on cell shape and size from just two clones, both obtained from one person’s femoral head tissues. Each clone was derived from a single cell from the person. We call these two clones clone A and clone B. Today, we will use our data analysis skills to explore how these cell line differ. Remember, these two cell lines were both obtained from one person. You probably have these kinds of MSCs too."

Each clones was cultured and the microscope captured cell shape an size information for thousands of cells from each clone (clone A and clone B). For each clone, we measured three biological replicates.\nThe Livecyte tracked each cell every 23 minutes, giving each data point a tracking ID (which tracks a unique cell ‘object’) and a lineage ID, which recalls the lineage of cells as they divide. For example, if cell 1, divied into cell 1A and cell 1B, they are all recorded by the Livecyte as being part of lineage ID 1.\nThis video shows what Livecyte can do (perhaps turn the sound down, or whatch later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological replicates and technical replicates\n\n\n\nA biological replicate repeats an experiment from different cell types, tissue types, or organisms to see if similar results can be observed.\nTechnical replicates are repeat measurements of the same biological material, which help to show how much variation comes from the equipment or different methods (rather from the biology).\nOur replicates are almost biological replicates, because we grew the cells three times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking like a data scientist\n\n\n\nData science can be challenging when you first start.

    "text": "3.7 Making plots\nIt looks like many of the cell shape metrics from above might differ between clones. So let’s look deeper, starting with cell width. We will make a box and whisker plot. We use a small ‘trick’ here: by including fill=replicate we force R to make different plots for each replicate.\n\nggplot(cells,aes(x=clone,y=width,fill=replicate))+\n    geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking plots with ggplot\n\n\n\nNo matter what shape plot you want, ggplot uses the same syntax.\n\nStart by telling R what data you want to use like this: ggplot(some_data_frame,aes(x=x_axis_data, y=y_axis_data) +\n\n\nIn this line, x_axis_data and y_axis_data are columns of some_data_frame.\n\nThen define what the shape plot you want (the ‘geometry’): geom_boxplot(), geom_histogram() etc.\nAdd extra things to customise your plot, eg: xlab(\"my x axis label\")\n\n\nIf you are unsure what to do, it’s OK to ask! Googling “ggpplot how to make a boxplot” (or any other plot) will help.\n\n\nIt does look like clone A and clone B differ consistently in width, with all repeats. To prove this, we would like to do a statistical test. A Student’s t-Test t.test would work. But t-Test’s assume that the data are normally distributed (like a bell curve).\nWe can test this approximately by plotting data, as below. It doesn’t look perfectly ‘bell shaped’, so let’s play is safe and use a nonparametric test.\n\nggplot(cells, aes(x = width)) +\n  geom_density()\n\nThe nonparametric equivalent of a t-Test is a Wilcoxon rank sum test. There are two ways to run this test in R. We can do wilcox.test(vectorA, vectorB), where vectorA and vectorB contain the numeric values we want to test.\nBut does does not suit tidyverse data frames very well. So we will use the wilcox.test(numeric_values ~ category_name, data = some_data_frame) method, like so:\n\n#Wilcoxon rank sum test\n#To test if cloneA and cloneB have statistically different widths\nwilcox.test(width ~ clone, data = cells)\n\n\n    Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  width by clone\nW = 562074424, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\nBecause the p-value is very low (&lt; 2.2e-16), this means the null hypothesis (that both sets of numbers come from the same population) is very unlikely to be true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-parametric tests are safe\n\n\n\nParametric tests are based on assumptions about the distribution of the real data. Nonparametric statistics are not based on these assumptions. So they are safer. Many biological metrics need nonparametric tests.\n\n\n\n3.7.1 An easier way\nFortunately, you can add the results of nonparametric tests to ggplot, by adding stat_compare_means() to our plot. Note that below we do not force R to split up the replicates as we did above.\n\nggplot(cells,aes(x=clone,y=width))+\n    geom_boxplot()+\n    stat_compare_means()"

Reading through and/or trying out this code will enhance your skills.\nUse the dplyr tools group_by and summarise to calculate the average of all the cell shape measurements for each cell. Each cell is marked by the Livecyte software with a tracking id (tracking.id), so we group cells by this. The code group_by(clone, replicate, tracking.id) will group each measurement by the clone, replicate and tracking id, then the summarise part calculates the mean values for all our metrics:\n\n#take the mean of each unique tracking id\ntrackingid.summary.table&lt;-cells |&gt;\n    group_by(clone, replicate, tracking.id) |&gt;\n    summarise(\n        volume=median(volume),\n        mean.thickness=median(mean.thickness),\n        radius=median(radius),\n        area=median(area),\n        sphericity=median(sphericity),\n        length=median(length),\n        width=median(width),\n        dry.mass=median(dry.mass),\n        perimeter=median(perimeter),\n        length.to.width=median(length.to.width)\n    )\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'clone', 'replicate'. You can override\nusing the `.groups` argument.\n\n\nnames(cells)\nThen we use the dplyr function sample_n, which samples a number of rows from a data frame at random. If the data frame is grouped (which our data is), the number we set applies to each group:\n\n#collect a random subset, of 5 rows for each tracking id\ntrackingid.small.data &lt;- sample_n(trackingid.summary.table, 5)\n\n#check that we have\nnrow(trackingid.small.data)\nglimpse(trackingid.small.data)\n\nWe write the output to a file:\n\n#output trackingid.small.data as a tab-separated value (tsv) file\nwrite_tsv(trackingid.small.data, file =\"/Users/dj757/gd/modules/BIO66I/data/trackingid.small.data.tsv\")\n\nLook at the trackingid.small.data data frame, so we know what we have:\n\n#how many rows do we have?\nnrow(trackingid.small.data)\n\n#what does the data look like?\nview(trackingid.small.data)"
